# PACE — Permionics Analytical Calculation Engine

**PACE** is a professional-grade membrane process design tool developed for Permionics Membranes Pvt. Ltd. It enables engineers to design, simulate, and report on Reverse Osmosis (RO) and Ultrafiltration (UF) systems.

---

## Features

- **Intelligent Process Recommendation** — Automatically selects the optimal membrane technology and configuration based on feed water quality and project targets.
- **Full RO/NF System Design** — Multi-stage, multi-pass system design with element-level flux, pressure, and recovery calculations.
- **Scaling & Fouling Analysis** — PHREEQC-powered saturation index calculations for gypsum, calcium carbonate, silica, and other foulants.
- **Membrane Aging Models** — Physics-based aging predictions for permeability, salt rejection, and energy consumption over the plant lifetime.
- **Chemical Conditioning** — pH adjustment, antiscalant dosing, and CO₂ degassing simulation.
- **UF Pre-treatment Sizing** — Full UF module sizing, flux normalization, and backwash scheduling.
- **Automated PDF Reports** — One-click professional report generation with charts, tables, and project metadata.

### Entry Points

| Mode | Command |
|---|---|
| **Cloud / Railway** | `python backend/run_cloud.py` (reads `PORT` env var, binds `0.0.0.0`) |
| **Desktop / Local** | `python backend/run_desktop.py` (auto-finds free port, opens browser) |
| **Windows EXE** | `dist/PACE_Permionics.exe` (self-contained, no Python required) |

---

## Setup & Running Locally

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run the server
python backend/run_desktop.py
```

The app will automatically open in your default browser.

---

## Building the Windows Executable

```batch
build_exe.bat
```

The compiled executable will be placed in `dist/PACE_Permionics.exe`.

---

## Cloud Deployment

The application is deployed on **Railway** using the included `Dockerfile`. Any push to the `railway_deployment` branch triggers an automatic redeploy.
